# Objects and Functions

R objects store information.  We can create objects using assignment operators (= or <-).  Note that R is case sensitive.

R functions do things. 

```{r}
y = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y
mean(y)
Y <- 20
Y
```

# Working with Data

For this example, we will load a "built-in" data set.  
ALWAYS look at the data!

```{r}
data(chickwts)
str(chickwts)
```

# Summary Statistics and Graphics

We will use this data to illustrate some basic analysis in R. The goal is to get started using R instead of focusing on specific R functions.

For this example, we will ignore the "feed" info.  

Use $ to reference a specific column within a data.frame.  R requires code to exactly match the column names in the data.frame. 

```{r}
mean(chickwts$weight)
median(chickwts$weight)
hist(chickwts$weight)
boxplot(chickwts$weight)
```
